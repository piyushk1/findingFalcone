        <h1>Welcome to the Planet of Lengaburu</h1>
        <div>
          In the distant galaxy of Tara B, following a recent war with the
          neighboring planet Falicornia, King Shan has sentenced the Queen of
          Falicornia to 15 years of exile.
        </div>
        <div>
          Queen Al Falcone is now in hiding. However, if King Shan can locate
          her before her sentence expires, she will face an additional 15 years
          of exile...
        </div>
        <div>
          King Shan has received intelligence indicating that Al Falcone is
          concealed within one of these six planets: DonLon, Enchai, Jebing,
          Sapir, Lerbin, or Pingasor. Unfortunately, he has limited resources at
          his disposal and can only send his army to four of these planets. Your
          challenge is to assist King Shan in finding Queen Al Falcone.
